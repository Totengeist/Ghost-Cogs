fact = "The platypus's bill is not hard like a duck's, but soft and made of soft skin. It uses the snout to dig at the bottom of streams and it's electroreceptors detect the electric currents generated by its prey moving. The platypuses at the San Diego Safari Park are the only ones in the US. You can watch a livestream of their habitat here: https://sdzsafaripark.org/cams/platypus-cam"

fact = "Bactrian camels, the only camels that exist in the wild, have two humps which store fat. Camels have specialized blood sells which can store a large amount of water, allowing camels to absorb 53 galons of water in 3 minutes. Along with the Safari Park, San Diego is also home to camels at Oasis Camel Dairy and the San Diego Animal Sanctuary and Farm."

fact = "The least Bell's vireo is an endangered species local to California and Baja California. It spends the winters in southern Baja, then returns to southern California between April and September for breeding season. Due to heavy human development in their primary beach habitats, least Bell's vireos are currently seen nesting in unusual habitats in Orange County including eucalyptus and blue elderberry shrubs."

fact = "American badgers are members of the weasel family and are considered indicators of *habitat connectivity* for conserved uplands in San Diego. If a badger can successfully find food and mates, this may indicate that other small wildlife that uses the same habitats will also succeed. The US Geological Survey has found 50 badger locations in San Diego and [is asking the public for help reporting sightings](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/werc/science/american-badgers-san-diego-county)."

animal = "Argentine ant"
latin = "Linepithema humile"
image = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Linepithema_Argentine_ant.jpg"
feature = '''
Argentine ants are native to South America, but have spread across much of the world and are rated among the world's most invasive species. They are the most common species of ant in California, nesting opportunistically underground, in leaf litter, in cracks in concrete, between boards, and even in our homes.

Thanks to research performed in California, it was discovered that Argentine ants form super-colonies in which the workers and queens of separate nests mix freely among each other and dominate the areas they invade. Despite this, super colonies do clash. In 2004, it was estimated that the Very Large Colony and Lake Hodges Colony saw millions of casualties every month along a frontline that was a few miles long and only a few centimeters wide.

The ants have disrupted natural and agricultural environments across the world. The tend aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, which they harvest for a substance called "honeydew." Their protection of these plant pests, leads to an increase in their population and therefore local crop damage.

animal = "Peninsular Bighorn Sheep"
latin = "Ovis canadensis cremnobates"
image = "https://www.ndow.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ovis_canadensis_nelsoni.jpeg"
feature = '''
The peninsular bighorn sheep is native to the mountain ranges stretching from Southern California to the US-Mexico border, living in large herds without a dominance hierarchy. Rams establish dominance only during the mating season to determine access to partners. Their dominance display is like a gun duel: walking away from each other, turning to face each other, then lunging into headbutts.

Bighorn sheep are susceptible to scabies and pneumonia. Unlike other bighorn sheep, the Peninsular bighorn can go without water for extended periods. Their primary predators are black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, and mountain lions. Due to human fire suppression techniques in their natural habitat, there is increased cover available for predators, leading to increased predation. Since they are so sensitive to human-induced environmental issues, they are considered a good indicator of a healthy local environment.

Aside from their exhibit at the Safari Park, they can be seen in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Joshua Tree Nation Park, Death Valley National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve. They are featured on a US Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the Endangered Species set and are the the state mammal of Nevada and the mascot of the Autonomous University of Baja California.
